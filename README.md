# falling-particles-img
Falling particles effect made with HTML5 canvas and JS. You need to transform the image from PNG format to base64 in order to use this animation and work right.
The idea of using this format (base64) its becouse you need to store information from every pixel in a matrix and then animate every pixel depending on the information
you have. If the pixel brightness is high the particle will fall slowly and you will be able to see the animation better.
